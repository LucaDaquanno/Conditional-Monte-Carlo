# Conditional Monte-Carlo
Time-state conditioning probabilities are used to model the likelihood of transitioning between different states (returns or other risk drivers) over specific time intervals. These probabilities capture the relationship between different time periods and their corresponding states in a given system. In the context of financial analysis, time-state conditioning probabilities help quantify the probability of moving from one market state to another within a defined timeframe, considering the market view of the user about future performances.
